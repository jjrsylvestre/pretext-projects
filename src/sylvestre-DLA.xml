    <description>
        <p>
        	The goal of this book is to help students <em>learn about</em> mathematics rather than try to <em>teach</em> them <em>a bunch of</em> mathematics.
        	Using the paradigm of <em>guided-discovery</em>,
        	students are led to model mathematics as a <em>discipline</em> and <em>practice of thought and investigation</em>,
        	rather than merely <em>subject matter</em> to <em>absorb</em>.
        	The beautiful topic of linear algebra is well-suited to this philosophy and pedagogical approach,
        	as many of its fundamental patterns are readily apparent from approachable examples.
        </p>
        <p>
        	<alert>One-semester version:</alert>
        	systems and matrices;
        	vectors and vector spaces;
        	eigenvalues/eigenvectors and diagonalization.
        </p>
        <p>
        	<alert>Two-semester version:</alert>
        	material from the one-semester version with additional chapters on
        	complex matrices and spaces, and change of basis;
        	similarity and matrix forms;
        	inner product spaces;
        	linear transformations.
        	Also included are appendices on complex numbers and on performing typical calculations using
        	<url href="https://www.sagemath.org/" visual="sagemath.org">SageMath</url>.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Chapters are (mostly) consistently structured into the following sections to give the student a uniform flow to encountering each new collection of ideas and patterns:
        	<ul>
        		<li><alert>Discovery guide:</alert>
        			Initial encounter through discovery- and problem-solving-based activities.
        		</li>
        		<li><alert>Terminology and notation:</alert>
        			Introduction of the communication tools necessary to begin a more sophisticated conversation about the new topics.
        		</li>
        		<li><alert>Concepts:</alert>
        			Fuller discussion of the new topics, grounded in reflections on the questions and results of the Discovery guide section.
        		</li>
        		<li><alert>Examples:</alert>
        			Computational examples to assist students with the procedural tasks related to the new topics, as well as additional examples that serve to illustrate certain concepts.
        		</li>
        		<li><alert>Theory:</alert> A more formal and general description of the concepts, with proofs.</li>
        	</ul>
        	In addition,
        	<em>Exercises</em> and <em>Reflect on your understanding</em> (reading questions) sections are currently being added.
        </p>
        <p>

        	and the <url href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jsylvest/books/DLA/preface.html#preface">Preface</url>
